## PWA & icons

- Manifest: `pwa/manifest.json`
- Service worker: `pwa/sw.js` (registered from `js/pwa.js`)
- Icons: `assets/icons/icon-192.png`, `assets/icons/icon-512.png` (used in manifest and apple-touch-icon)

Notes:
- Service worker enables offline caching and faster loads.
- Install prompt: a custom modal is shown using the `beforeinstallprompt` event; users can install via that modal or the browser UI.

## Running & testing PWA locally

Service workers and the install flow require HTTPS OR `localhost`. Recommended steps:

1. Serve the repo with a local server (Live Server, `python -m http.server`, or `npx serve`).
2. Open DevTools → Application:
   - Manifest: verify icons and display: standalone
   - Service Workers: confirm `/pwa/sw.js` is registered and active
3. To test offline: enable "Offline" in DevTools → Network and reload — app should still load from cache.
4. To test install flow: either accept the browser install prompt or click the app's install button (modal will appear when `beforeinstallprompt` fires).

## Developer notes

- This repo is primarily client-side; Node is not required to run the app in the browser.
- A small Node helper used for icon resizing was removed. To regenerate icons programmatically later, add a script and reinstall dependencies.
- Whenever you update assets referenced by the service worker, increment `CACHE_NAME` in `pwa/sw.js` so clients refresh their cache.
